# beatbox
Ahoy! This is an immature product under active development.  

Beattbox seeks to do what Fragstats does, but scalable for computing across large landscapes and deployable in high-performance computing environments. Although currently built-on GDAL (and derivitives, such as georasters), we intend a build-out that leverages newer (faster) C/C++ Orfeo implementation. When it's done, we are going to use it to inform habitat work for migratory birds and waterfowl across the Great Plains. But it's utility could be much broader.

If you are interested in tackling beastly, unwieldy and important problems in ecoinformatics -- as we are -- please get in touch.
