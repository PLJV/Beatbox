# Beatbox
Ahoy! This is an immature product under active development.  

## what does it do?
Beatbox seeks to do what Fragstats does, but as framework that is scalable for computing problems across very large landscapes and deployable in high-performance unix environments. Although currently built-on GDAL (and derivitives, such as georasters), we intend a build-out that leverages a newer (faster) C/C++ Orfeo implementation (when Orgeo finally hits Python 3.x). In the meantime, we will straddle an implementation that uses GDAL/Numpy and Orfeo on 2.7.X. We will slowly test the implementation against our biological  monitoring data. When it's done, we are going to unleash it on that messy mosaic that is North America's grasslands and use it to inform habitat work for migratory birds and waterfowl across the Great Plains. And then we are going to pass it on to the world to hack and make better.

If you are interested in tackling beastly, unwieldy and important problems in ecoinformatics -- as we are -- please get in touch.
