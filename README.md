Ahoy! This is an immature product under active development that seeks to do what Fragstats does, but at-scale across large landscapes and using newer (faster) C/C++ libraries. If you are into open-source development, remote sensing, spatial modeling, C/C++ and Python and are interested in tackling beastly, unwieldy and important problems in ecoinformatics -- as we are -- get in touch.
